# Fields

The selectable members of a response `Document`, and how much of each to return.

`Document.url` and `Document.published_date` are always selected.

Each member takes `true`, `false`, or an object of ceilings. An object selects the member and
bounds it, so `{"content": {"max_characters_per_result": 500}}` returns content and no
snippets. `{"content": true}` selects content under the default ceiling, which is what
`{"content": {}}` returns as well. `false` switches the member off.

A `fields` that names neither member returns the defaults below, so `{}` and a wholly absent
`fields` mean the same thing. A `fields` that names either is read literally, so
`{"snippets": true}` returns passages and no content.

*This model accepts additional fields of type unknown.*
